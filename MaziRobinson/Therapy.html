			<p style="text-align:justify;">As a Licensed Therapist, Mazi believes that counseling can help you move from the life you are wrestling in to the life you were created to live. In her Atlanta therapy practice, Mazi helps her clients understand the relationship between their thoughts, feelings, and actions, as well as how past and present life events and relationships influence that pattern.  Having trained with shame and vulnerability researcher and best selling author, Dr. Brene Brown, Mazi helps individuals address lingering struggles with shame and insecurity as they learn to live bravely by embracing vulnerability.</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing where to start or how to talk about your concerns can feel like a daunting task.  Research continuously shows that the most effective way to overcome emotional hurt and negative thinking is to talk about these struggles. Remaining silent only intensifies the sadness, anxiety, shame, and grief.</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Sharing your story with a counselor provides you the opportunity to release those uncomfortable feelings and negative thoughts in a non-judgmental, empathetic, compassionate setting.</b></p> 
			<p style="text-align:justify;">Mazi sees her role as a Therapist as that of a companion who listens and helps you identify themes and patterns while providing support and encouragement along the way.  She will help  you face life’s difficulties and make positive changes in your life.</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Deciding to begin your therapy journey is a courageous first step.</b></p> 
			<p style="text-align:justify;">Giving yourself the gift of therapy provides you with the tools, insight, and skills that allow you to continue growing and evolving in your personal journey.</p>

		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<p style="text-align:justify;">Mazi Robinson is a trusted Atlanta therapist helping women discover their true voice as they navigate self esteem and self worth challenges, relationship issues, and life stage transitions such as young adulthood, motherhood, and mid-life.</p> 
			<p style="text-align:justify;">There comes a point in everyone’s journey where the past hurts, the losses, and relationship conflict, and the stress of everyday life gets to be too much. You want things to change, but you don’t know where to start. You want to be free of the worries and frustrations, but you don’t understand what is keeping you stuck in the pattern. After years of trying to be everything to everyone, you realize you have lost your voice, your sense of self.</p>  
			<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Therapy can help you move toward the growth and change you’ve been seeking.</b></p> 
			<p style="text-align:justify;">Through counseling, you will enhance your self-awareness and self-acceptance, and as a result, you will begin to experience more freedom and peace in all areas of your life.  You can discover your true voice and step off the treadmill of self-doubt and criticism.</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">Finding your voice means believing you are enough and that your worth is not determined by the fullness of your calendar, the shape of your body, the number of checks on your to do list, or the status of your relationships.</p>
