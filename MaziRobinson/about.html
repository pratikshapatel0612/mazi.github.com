			<h1>The Story Behind My Passion for Helping Women </h1>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">Long before I was a speaker or counselor or teacher or wife and mother, I was a singer. There have been so many years and life experiences since then that it is almost hard to remember that period. What I do remember very clearly, though, is how much I enjoyed my voice lessons.</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">Truth be told, I enjoyed the voice lessons more than I enjoyed performing for it was in the lesson that you really grew as a musician.You dove into the nuances and interpretations of the music, and sometimes just thinking of a phrase differently changed the way you sounded.Mistakes were expected.<b> You grew and learned because of those missed notes and missteps, and the hardest lesson often ended up being the most helpful.</b></p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<p style="text-align:justify;">My passion for helping women discover their true voice is fueled by my own journey of losing and rediscovering my own voice.Many years ago, I realized I had grown silent in my own life. I was caught in unhealthy patterns and relationships, and instead of thriving, I was just existing.<b>Discovering my voice meant healing old wounds,surrendering even older lies,and taking baby steps and leaps of courage and faith both personally and professionally.</b></p>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">What I’ve learned along the way is that discovering and using our voice is a journey of life changing lessons. Yes, at some point in time, we all lose our way.  The path gets clouded with bad choices or life events that are out of our control, but on that path littered with disappointments,difficulties, and challenges, we find markings of grace and learn that no life experience is wasted.  The experience becomes a lesson.</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>We can all find our voice in the midst of the lesson.I look forward to journeying with you!</b></p>
